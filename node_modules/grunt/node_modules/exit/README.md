# exit [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cowboy/node-exit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cowboy/node-exit)

A replacement for process.exit that ensures stdio are fully drained before exiting.

To make a long story short, if `process.exit` is called on Windows, script output is often truncated when pipe-redirecting `stdout` or `stderr`. This module attempts to work around this issue by waiting until those streams have been completely drained before actually calling `process.exit`.

See [Node.js issue #3584](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3584) for further reference.

Tested in OS X 10.8, Windows 7 on Node.js 0.8.25 and 0.10.18.

Based on some code by [@vladikoff](https://github.com/vladikoff).

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install exit`

```javascript
var exit = require('exit');

// These lines should appear in the output, EVEN ON WINDOWS.
console.log("omg");
console.error("yay");

// process.exit(5);
exit(5);

// These lines shouldn't appear in the output.

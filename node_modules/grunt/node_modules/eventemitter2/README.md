# SYNOPSIS

EventEmitter2 is an implementation of the EventEmitter found in Node.js

# DESCRIPTION

### FEATURES
 - Namespaces/Wildcards.
 - Times To Listen (TTL), extends the `once` concept with `many`.
 - Browser environment compatibility.
 - Demonstrates good performance in benchmarks

```
EventEmitterHeatUp x 3,728,965 ops/sec \302\2610.68% (60 runs sampled)
EventEmitter x 2,822,904 ops/sec \302\2610.74% (63 runs sampled)
EventEmitter2 x 7,251,227 ops/sec \302\2610.55% (58 runs sampled)
EventEmitter2 (wild) x 3,220,268 ops/sec \302\2610.44% (65 runs sampled)
Fastest is EventEmitter2
```

### Differences (Non breaking, compatible with existing EventEmitter)

 - The constructor takes a configuration object.
 
```javascript
    var EventEmitter2 = require('eventemitter2').EventEmitter2;
    var server = new EventEmitter2({

      //
      // use wildcards.
      //
      wildcard: true,

      //
      // the delimiter used to segment namespaces, defaults to `.`.
      //
      delimiter: '::', 
      
      //
      // if you want to emit the newListener event set to true.
      //
      newListener: false, 

      //
      // max listeners that can be assigned to an event, default 10.
      //
      maxListeners: 20
    });
```

 - Getting the actual event that fired.

```javascript
    server.on('foo.*', function(value1, value2) {
      console.log(this.event, value1, value2);
    });
```

 - Fire an event N times and then remove it, an extension of the `once` concept.

```javascript
    server.many('foo', 4, function() {
      console.log('hello');
    });
```

 - Pass in a namespaced event as an array rather than a delimited string.

```javascript
    server.many(['foo', 'bar', 'bazz'], function() {
      console.log('hello');
    });
```


# API

When an `EventEmitter` instance experiences an error, the typical action is
to emit an `error` event. Error events are treated as a special case.
If there is no listener for it, then the default action is to print a stack
trace and exit the program.

All EventEmitters emit the event `newListener` when new listeners are
added.


**Namespaces** with **Wildcards**
To use namespaces/wildcards, pass the `wildcard` option into the EventEmitter 
constructor. When namespaces/wildcards are enabled, events can either be 
strings (`foo.bar`) separated by a delimiter or arrays (`['foo', 'bar']`). The 
delimiter is also configurable as a constructor option.

An event name passed to any event emitter method can contain a wild card (the 
`*` character). If the event name is a string, a wildcard may appear as `foo.*`. 
If the event name is an array, the wildcard may appear as `['foo', '*']`.

If either of the above described events were passed to the `on` method, 
subsequent emits such as the following would be observed...

```javascript
   emitter.emit('foo.bazz');
   emitter.emit(['foo', 'bar']);
```


### emitter.addListener(event, listener)
### emitter.on(event, listener)

Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.

```javascript
    server.on('data', function(value1, value2, value3, ...) {
      console.log('The event was raised!');
    });
```

```javascript
    server.on('data', function(value) {
      console.log('The event was raised!');
    });
```

### emitter.onAny(listener)

Adds a listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.

```javascript
    server.onAny(function(value) {
      console.log('All events trigger this.');
    });
```

### emitter.offAny(listener)

Removes the listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.

```javascript
    server.offAny(function(value) {
      console.log('The event was raised!');
    });
```

#### emitter.once(event, listener)

Adds a **one time** listener for the event. The listener is invoked 
only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.

```javascript
    server.once('get', function (value) {
      console.log('Ah, we have our first

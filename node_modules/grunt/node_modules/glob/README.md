# Glob

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

## Attention: node-glob users!

The API has changed dramatically between 2.x and 3.x. This library is
now 100% JavaScript, and the integer flags have been replaced with an
options object.

Also, there's an event emitter class, proper tests, and all the other
things you've come to expect from node modules.

And best of all, no compilation!

## Usage

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options

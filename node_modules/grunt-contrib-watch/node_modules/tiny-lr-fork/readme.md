This is a fork of tiny-lr. The maintainer of tiny-lr appears to be on a hiatus and this fork takes care of lingering issues until the maintainer of tiny-lr (hopefully) returns.

**Changes made:**

* Quieter, removes `console.log`s
* Use WSS when livereload.js is on HTTPS
* Normalize windows paths in livereload.js

This script manages a tiny [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) server
implementation you can spawn in the background.

It exposes:

- a background-friendly bin wrapper (thanks to
  [@FGRibreau](https://github.com/FGRibreau) [pid.js
  gist](https://gist.github.com/1846952))

- [Grunt tasks](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr#using-grunt) to start the server and trigger reload notification. Every task
  name is prefixed by `tinylr-`.

- [Generic targets](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr#using-make) to include in
  your Makefile (`include node_modules/tiny-lr/tasks/tiny-lr.mk`)

It doesn't have any watch ability, it must be done at the build process or
application level.

Instead, it exposes a very simple API to notify the server that some
changes have been made, that is then broadcasted to every livereload client
connected.

    # notify a single change
    curl http://localhost:35729/changed?files=style.css

    # notify using a longer path
    curl http://localhost:35729/changed?files=js/app.js

    # notify multiple changes, comma or space delimited
    curl http://localhost:35729/changed?files=index.html,style.css,docs/docco.css

Or you can bulk the information into a POST request, with body as a JSON array of files.

    curl -X POST http://localhost:35729/changed -d '{ "files": ["style.css", "app.js"] }'

As for the livereload client, you need to install the browser extension:

(**note**: you need to listen on port 35729 to be able to use with your
brower extension)

or add the livereload script tag manually:
